<h2 id="11-waiver-severability--entire-agreement">11. WAIVER, SEVERABILITY &amp; ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
<h3 id="waiver">Waiver</h3>
<p>The failure of Krypton Game to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<h3 id="severability">Severability</h3>
<p>In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h3 id="entire-agreement">Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>These Terms and our Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive agreement between Krypton Game and you regarding use of the Sites (excluding any services for which you have a separate written agreement with Krypton Game that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Krypton Game and you regarding use of the Sites.</p>
<h2 id="12-legal-disputes">12. LEGAL DISPUTES</h2>
<h3 id="applicable-law-and-class-action-and-jury-waiver">Applicable Law and Class Action and Jury Waiver</h3>
<p>You hereby agree to resolve all disputes through binding individual arbitration, which means that you waive any right to have those disputes decided by a judge or jury, and that you waive your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or representative actions. YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, IN PARTICULAR THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Krypton Game ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION OR OTHER ACTION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. You agree that the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Krypton Game, except as otherwise stated in these Terms.</p>
<h3 id="binding-arbitration">Binding Arbitration</h3>
<p>If you and the Company are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or the Company may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, the Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<h3 id="judicial-forum-for-legal-disputes-other-than-copyright-matters">Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes Other Than Copyright Matters</h3>
<p>Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Binding Arbitration provision above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Krypton Game must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York City, New York. You and Krypton Game agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York City, New York for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>
<h3 id="judicial-forum-for-legal-copyright-matters">Judicial Forum for Legal Copyright Matters</h3>
<p>You agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you (or an entity on whose behalf you are visiting Krypton Game’s sites) and Krypton Game regarding infringement of a copyright must be resolved exclusively by the Copyright Claims Board.</p>
<h2 id="13-statute-of-limitations">13. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</h2>
<p>You and the Company both agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Sites, Terms, or Privacy Policy must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
<h2 id="14-notification-of-changes-to-terms-of-service">14. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
