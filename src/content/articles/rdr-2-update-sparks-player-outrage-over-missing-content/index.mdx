**The Wild West is restless. Rockstar Games' latest patch for *Red Dead Redemption 2* has landed, but instead of celebrating, the game's dedicated fanbase is in open revolt, heavily criticizing the update for a severe lack of meaningful content and, more crucially, the snub of a long-awaited next-generation upgrade.**

The core of the frustration stems from the highly successful 2018 title still running at a 30 frames-per-second (fps) cap on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles. While other major titles from the previous console generation have received free or paid "Expanded and Enhanced" patches to enable 60fps performance—including Rockstar's own *Grand Theft Auto V*—*RDR2* remains visually and technically behind for its current-gen players.

Fans have long petitioned and speculated about a patch that would simply unlock the framerate, arguing that the powerful new hardware is more than capable of running the game at a smooth 60fps. The recent patch, which arrived after a significant drought of new content, was hoped to be this long-awaited moment.

### A Patch Focused on Fixes, Not Features

Instead of the performance boost or significant additions to *Red Dead Online* that the community clamored for, the update primarily delivered bug fixes and minor stability improvements. While fixing glitches is appreciated, the minimal nature of the changes, especially after months of silence from the developer, has been seen as a profound disappointment and a sign of neglect.

Many players interpret the studio's reluctance to release a next-gen patch for *RDR2* as a strategy to save it as a major selling point for a potential future re-release or "remaster," a move which has historically proven unpopular with the fanbase.

### Community Reaction: A 'Next-Gen Snub'

Social media platforms are now awash with angry comments and memes, with players using hashtags to voice their disappointment. The collective sentiment is one of feeling ignored, particularly given the game's status as a critical and commercial masterpiece.

"It's criminal that one of the best-looking games ever made is still stuck at 30fps on a PS5," commented one fan on a popular subreddit, summarizing the widespread frustration.

As the industry moves closer to the launch of *Grand Theft Auto VI*, many in the *Red Dead Redemption 2* community fear that the focus on the next major title is consuming all of Rockstar's development resources, leaving the Wild West without the technical TLC it desperately needs. Until an official announcement arrives, the silence from Rockstar is only making the player outrage louder.
