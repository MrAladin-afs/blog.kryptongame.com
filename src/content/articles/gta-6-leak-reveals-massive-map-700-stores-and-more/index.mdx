Excitement for *Grand Theft Auto VI* continues to build, and while official details from Rockstar Games remain scarce, a steady stream of unofficial reports and community speculation has painted a picture of a game world unlike any other. The latest wave of rumors suggests that the map, centered around Vice City and the state of Leonida, will be vastly more expansive and interactive than its predecessors, potentially featuring over **700 enterable shops**, the return of a chaotic **6-star wanted level**, and rich **explorable underwater areas**.

**A New Level of Interactivity: Hundreds of Enterable Locations**

One of the most buzzworthy and transformative rumors centers on the sheer number of interiors available to players. Unlike previous *Grand Theft Auto* titles where many buildings served as static backdrop elements, leaks suggest that *GTA VI* could feature **more than 700 enterable stores and locations**.

This purported level of interior density—which is said to include everything from small pawn shops and supermarkets to fully functional malls and explorable skyscrapers with working elevators—would drastically increase the realism and immersion of the open world. Furthermore, sources hint that many of these locations will be available for players to rob, adding a new layer to the open-world heist gameplay and making the environment a more dynamic playground for criminal activity.

**The Ultimate Challenge Returns: The 6-Star Wanted Level**

For longtime fans of the series, the news of a potential **6-star wanted level** is a welcome rumor. This feature, which was a hallmark of earlier *GTA* games but absent in *Grand Theft Auto V*, signifies the ultimate police response, typically calling in the full force of military-grade units like tanks and jets.

The return of the 6-star wanted level suggests that *GTA VI* aims to deliver an unparalleled level of chaos and challenge for players who push the boundaries of the law. Should this rumor prove true, escaping the full might of the state of Leonida’s law enforcement at the highest level would become a legendary test of skill, vehicles, and map knowledge.

**Dive into the Deep: Explorable Underwater Areas**

The map of *GTA VI* is set in the fictional state of Leonida, an analogue to Florida, which is defined by its extensive coastline, islands (The Leonida Keys), and swampy wetlands (The Grassrivers). Given this setting, another exciting unconfirmed detail is the inclusion of **richly explorable underwater areas**.

In *GTA V*, underwater exploration was present but largely empty. Current rumors suggest that *GTA VI* will fully capitalize on its coastal setting, featuring vibrant underwater environments packed with secrets, treasure, and potentially unique activities. This could open up a whole new dimension of exploration, from deep-sea diving off the Keys to traversing the murky depths of the swampy interior. The scale of the map, which is already speculated to be at least twice the size of *GTA V*'s, would be further expanded by a detailed ocean floor.

**The Disclaimer: Unofficial and Unconfirmed**

It is critical to note that all of these details remain **unofficial leaks and rumors**. Rockstar Games has not confirmed any of the specifics regarding the number of interiors, the wanted system mechanics, or the extent of underwater content. Fans should treat this information as speculation until an official announcement is made.

Nevertheless, the collective rumors paint an ambitious picture of *Grand Theft Auto VI*—a massive, meticulously detailed world that promises a revolutionary leap in open-world interactivity and dynamic gameplay. If even a fraction of these features makes it into the final release, the state of Leonida is set to become the most compelling and detailed setting in video game history.
