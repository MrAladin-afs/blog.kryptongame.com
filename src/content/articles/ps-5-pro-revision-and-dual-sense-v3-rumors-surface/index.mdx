The gaming world is abuzz with reports of a potential hardware refresh for the PlayStation 5 Pro console, which was already a mid-generation upgrade to the standard PS5. Leaks from reliable industry sources suggest Sony is quietly rolling out a new version of the PS5 Pro, with the model number CFI-7121, primarily in Europe.2



The most consistent speculation points to a **minor internal revision** focused on better energy efficiency, with some reports suggesting the new model will consume approximately 3% less power than the current version.3 This follows a pattern of Sony releasing minor, unannounced console tweaks throughout a generation to optimize manufacturing or comply with evolving regulations. Crucially, the good news for gamers is that the revised PS5 Pro is expected to **retain its substantial 2TB SSD storage capacity** and maintain its existing price point in Europe, avoiding the storage reduction seen with some revisions of the base PS5 model.4



Perhaps more exciting for many players is the accompanying rumor of a new controller, internally referred to as the **DualSense V3**. This revised gamepad is expected to address a long-standing request from the community by featuring a **removable battery**. If true, this quality-of-life improvement would allow users to easily swap in a charged spare or replace the battery when its capacity degrades, significantly extending the controller's practical lifespan. Reports indicate the DualSense V3 could be available as a standalone purchase and potentially be bundled with the new PS5 Pro console.

While Sony has not officially confirmed these revisions, the consistent leaks suggest that the company is continuing to optimize its current console lineup and respond to player feedback on accessory design, promising a slightly refined experience for new purchasers.
