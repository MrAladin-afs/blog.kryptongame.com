Third-party accessory maker PowerA, a long-standing official partner of Nintendo, has announced its first line of licensed controllers for the recently released Nintendo Switch 2 console. The new **Advantage Wired** and **Advantage Wireless** controllers aim to provide players with affordable, feature-rich alternatives to Nintendo's own Pro Controller.

The most significant upgrade for the new Advantage line is the inclusion of **Hall Effect sensor technology** in the thumbsticks. This is a major selling point, as Hall Effect sticks use magnets instead of traditional physical friction, which greatly reduces the risk of the notorious "stick drift" issue that plagued controllers for the original Switch. The wired version is particularly budget-friendly, while the wireless option offers up to 30 hours of play.

In terms of design and features, the controllers are built to support the Switch 2's new capabilities. They include a dedicated **"C Button"** for quick access to the new in-game chat features on the console. Furthermore, the wired controller is one of the first third-party options to include an onboard 3.5mm audio jack with audio controls and multiple EQ modes. PowerA is also offering a new **Slim Case** and screen protectors specifically designed to fit the Switch 2's slightly larger form factor.

While the PowerA controllers lack some features of the official Pro Controller—such as HD Rumble, motion controls, and NFC support for Amiibo—they offer a compelling package for players seeking high-quality, officially licensed gear with enhanced thumbstick longevity at a more accessible price.
